## Metropolitan Climate Profiling: Advanced Analytics of Urban Heat Islands

![UHI Title](./images/UHI_Title.png)


The main goal of this project is to delve into climatological data for three cities—Dallas, Denton, and Arlington—in and around the Dallas, TX region. The focus is on understanding and categorizing these cities based on the "Urban Heat Island" (UHI) scale.

In climatology, UHI denotes urban areas with higher temperatures compared to neighboring rural areas. This phenomenon arises due to the replacement of natural landscapes with structures that absorb and retain heat, forming what is commonly known as a "micro climate." Essentially, a city's infrastructure creates its own localized weather conditions.

By scrutinizing micro climate data for Dallas, a major urban hub, along with Denton and Arlington as suburban counterparts, the aim is to establish a classification system that reflects different UHI intensities and assign corresponding labels to these cities. Furthermore, a temporal analysis is conducted to compare and contrast various weather patterns associated with different UHI intensities.

This project seeks to enhance our understanding of how urbanization influences local climates, particularly in the context of the Dallas area, and contribute valuable insights into the classification and temporal patterns of Urban Heat Islands.
